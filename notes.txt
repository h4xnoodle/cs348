notes

Install ZEND CE edition
enable pdo_ibm ext
new PDO("ibm:DRIVER={IBM DB2 ODBC DRIVER};DATABASE=<DB>;HOSTNAME=localhost;PORT=50000;PROTOCOL=TCPIP;", <USER>, <PASS>);

Need new table(s) for billing shit

Design:

- Restrict new EDT record to physicians, with dropdown.
- Change edtrecords DURATION to DECIMAL
- Changed CheckInOuts to allow two physicians, and another ID, and primary key
- Must be patient before billing account - rm duplicate entering of info. Automagically filled in from patient file
	- allowed blank insurance
- added "ON DELETE CASCADE" to all foreign keys
- could create indices
- preqs: add physicians
- added transforms
