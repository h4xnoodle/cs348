Install ZEND CE edition
enable pdo_ibm ext
new PDO("ibm:DRIVER={IBM DB2 ODBC DRIVER};DATABASE=<DB>;HOSTNAME=localhost;PORT=50000;PROTOCOL=TCPIP;", <USER>, <PASS>);


Design:

- Restrict new EDT record to physicians, with dropdown. NO-allow manual entry, but checks
- Must be patient before billing account - rm duplicate entering of info. Automagically filled in from patient file

- could create indices on: employees, jobs, possibly patients (access >>> insert/delete).
- preqs: add physicians

DDL CHANGES
- Changed edtrecords DURATION to DECIMAL
- Changed CheckInOuts to allow two physicians, and another ID, and primary key
- added transforms
- added "ON DELETE CASCADE" to all foreign keys
